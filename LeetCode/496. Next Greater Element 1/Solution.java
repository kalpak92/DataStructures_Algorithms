/**
 * You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. 
 * Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
 * 
 * The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. 
 * If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
 * Output: [-1,3,-1]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
 * For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
 * For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
 * Output: [3,-1]
 * Explanation:
 * For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
 * For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
 * 
 * Note:
 * All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
 * The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.
 *
