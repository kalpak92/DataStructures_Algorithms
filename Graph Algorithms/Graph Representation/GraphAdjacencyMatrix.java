/**
 * Graph is a collection of nodes or vertices (V) and edges(E) between them. We can traverse these nodes using the edges. 
 * These edges might be weighted or non-weighted.
 * 
 * Adjacency Matrix is 2-Dimensional Array which has the size VxV, where V are the number of vertices in the graph.
 * 
 * adjMaxtrix[i][j] = 1 when there is edge between Vertex i and Vertex j, else 0.
 * Itâ€™s easy to implement because removing and adding an edge takes only O(1) time.
 * But the drawback is that it takes O(V2) space even though there are very less edges in the graph.
